# OHLC indicators

OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) indicators are a specific category of technical indicators
used to generate values based on the open, high, low, and close prices of an asset.
The OHLC values can be used to construct candlestick charts,
which visually represent the price movements in the market.

One example of an OHLC indicator is the Heikin-Ashi (HA) indicator.
Heikin-Ashi is known for its ability to filter out the noise
of day-to-day price fluctuations and provide a smoother representation of price data.
It achieves this by using a modified formula based on average price values.

The Heikin-Ashi method calculates the open, high, low, and close values
based on the average of the previous candle's OHLC values.
This averaging technique helps to reduce the impact of sudden price spikes or gaps,
resulting in smoother candlestick patterns.
The modified candlestick charts generated by the Heikin-Ashi indicator
can provide clearer signals for identifying market trends and forecasting price movements.

OHLC indicators, can be used in conjunction with other indicators or analysis
techniques.  The OHLC values they produce can serve as input for other
indicators allowing traders to derive additional insights or develop trading
strategies based on the price data.

By utilizing OHLC indicators, traders can gain a better understanding of price dynamics,
identify key support and resistance levels, and recognize patterns
that may indicate potential trading opportunities.
The visual representation of OHLC values through candlestick charts
facilitates the interpretation of market sentiment and price action.

## Heikin Ashi Smoothed

The Heikin Ashi Smoothed indicator is a variation of the Heikin Ashi indicator,
which itself is a type of OHLC indicator used to represent price movements
more smoothly and filter out noise. The Heikin Ashi Smoothed indicator
takes the concept of Heikin Ashi a step further by applying smoothing
techniques to the calculations by The calculating the moving averages (MA)
of the open, close, low, and high prices for a specified MA period.
