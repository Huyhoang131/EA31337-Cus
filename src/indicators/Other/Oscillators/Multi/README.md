# Oscillator multi-value indicators

Multi-value oscillators, often referred to as "multi-line" or "multi-buffer"
oscillators, are a variation of traditional oscillators used in technical
analysis. While traditional oscillators like the RSI or Stochastic oscillator
generate a single line that oscillates within a specific range,
multi-value oscillators plot multiple lines
or buffers on a histogram-like chart.

These additional lines on the histogram provide traders and analysts with
more information and insights into the price movement and momentum of an
asset. Each line represents a different aspect of price behavior, allowing
for a more comprehensive analysis of market conditions.

The interaction and relationship between these multiple lines can offer
valuable signals and indications of potential market trends, reversals, or
momentum shifts. Traders often look for crossovers, divergences, and
patterns among the lines to make more informed trading decisions.
